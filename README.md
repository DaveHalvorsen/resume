# resume
I made my resume in HTML and CSS. This layout is mostly the Free Responsive HTML/CSS3 CV Template from Thomas Hardy. The original files are located here: http://www.thomashardy.me.uk/free-responsive-html-css3-cv-template
I made slight changes from the initial file: 

1. changed CSS so that it no longer turns my Jekyll static site gray
2. got rid of the slow reveal invisible -> resume format
3. got rid of the picture
4. got rid of the old contact me info from the bottom (cause Jekyll creates that automatically)
5. moved skills section higher up
6. added bulleted lists to the previous jobs section
7. added new links to my github, email address and website
