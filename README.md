# resume
I made my resume in HTML and CSS. This layout is mostly the Free Responsive HTML/CSS3 CV Template from Thomas Hardy. The original files are located here: http://www.thomashardy.me.uk/free-responsive-html-css3-cv-template
I made slight changes from the initial file: 

-changed CSS so that it no longer turns my Jekyll static site gray
-got rid of the slow reveal invisible -> resume format
-got rid of the picture
-got rid of the old contact me info from the bottom (cause Jekyll creates that automatically)
-moved skills section higher up
-added bulleted lists to the previous jobs section
-added new links to my github, email address and website
